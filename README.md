# IoT Stream 2019 (ECMLPKDD2019 Workshop) - SPICE: Streaming PCA fault Identification and Classification Engine in Predictive Maintenance
This repository contains the source code for the ECML2019 paper Streaming PCA: Towards Guarantees for Low-latency High-throughput Processing.

The code is available for review only, as it needs considerable infrastructure work to run the benchmarks without completing the necessary configuration steps. However, we believe it should be sufficient to have a glimpse of the processes executed and therefore interpret the performance results presented in the paper.
